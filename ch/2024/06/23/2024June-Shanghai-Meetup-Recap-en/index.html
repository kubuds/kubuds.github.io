<p><strong>openEuler RISC-V SIG Maintainer, CTO Wang Junqiang of Kubuds Tech, shared a speech titled ‘LLVM Parallel Universe: Towards a Multi-Star Civilization, Announcing the Quantum Leap Path’</strong></p>

<p><img src="2024/06/23/2024June-Shanghai-Meetup-Recap/5.webp" alt="image" /></p>

<p>Mr. Wang Junqiang first introduced the development history of the LLVM Parallel Universe Project and briefly shared its progress over the past year, supported by the openEuler RISC-V SIG and openEuler Compiler SIG.</p>

<p>Immediately after, he presented the newly launched openKylin LLVM Parallel Universe Project (launched this month) and elaborated on the content of the J126 internship position—established under the “RISC-V Prosperity 2036 Open-Source Intern Joint Recruitment and Training Program”. He called on more college students to join the LLVM Parallel Universe, describing it as a highly engaging project.</p>

<p>Wang Junqiang also introduced KarsierOS to the audience. KarsierOS is a downstream commercial distribution derived from the achievements of the openEuler LLVM Parallel Universe by <strong>Kubuds Tech</strong>, scheduled for official release at the RISC-V China Summit on August 21. This might be the first commercial distribution based on the Parallel Universe outcomes.</p>

<p>The most compelling part of his sharing came at the end: <a href="http://mp.weixin.qq.com/s?__biz=MzkwODYyMTQ2NA==&amp;mid=2247483936&amp;idx=1&amp;sn=9c943b03f12a68f5fffc4e83e5a51965&amp;chksm=c0c661d7f7b1e8c16fdf35d48b0dc2dca4fea07e46dffb5160fd727ecf53a06be1d0c233cfbd&amp;scene=21#wechat_redirect">Mr. Wang Junqiang officially unveiled the “Quantum Leap Path” Project </a>. The plan aims to achieve the freedom to switch compilers, linkers, and basic libraries of the “full-system software supply chain” on demand within approximately five years.</p>

<p><strong>Engineer Zhou Jiacheng from the OERV team of the Institute of Software, Chinese Academy of Sciences, shared a speech titled ‘Introduction and Progress of the openEuler LLVM Parallel Universe Plan’.</strong></p>

<p><img src="2024/06/23/2024June-Shanghai-Meetup-Recap/6.webp" alt="image" /></p>

<p>Zhou Jiacheng first reviewed the background of the LLVM Parallel Universe Project—namely, the open-source community’s journey of building Linux distributions with LLVM Clang. He then gave a basic introduction to the project: it aims to replace the GCC suite with the LLVM compiler suite to build Linux distributions and packages, developing in parallel with community versions independently. This is why the openEuler Community named the project “Parallel Universe”.</p>

<p>Then, he shared several major advantages of LLVM and the reasons for choosing it, including its excellent architecture design, friendly licensing, and vibrant ecosystem. Furthermore, he mentioned that LLVM is also competitive in areas like code quality detection, native support for Rust kernel driver development, and its widespread recognition in both industry and academia.</p>

<p>Subsequently, Zhou Jiacheng detailed the current status and operation mode of the openEuler Parallel Universe Project, including how to switch to the LLVM/Clang compiler during the build process, the scope of packages involved in the compiler switch, and the status of supporting infrastructure.</p>

<p>Finally, he shared information about the recent new version release of the openEuler Parallel Universe Project, download links, and the general plan for future development.</p>

<p><strong>Ms. Wang Wenjun, Chair of the Organizing Committee for the Second RISC-V Software Porting and Optimization Championship (RVSPOC), announced the opening of registrations and the start of the competition at this event.</strong></p>
